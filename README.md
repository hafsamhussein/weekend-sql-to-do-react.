# TODO App

## Description
This project is a simple ToDo App that helps users manage their tasks. They can add, complete, and delete tasks. This app also allows someone to hover from complete to incomplete, if accidentally clicked on complete. All tasks are stored in a SQL database, and the User Interface updates dynamically to show the current state of tasks.

## Features
Create a new Task with priority level
Mark tasks as complete or incomplete

All tasks are stored in a SQL database
Real-time update of tasks list
Stylish, user-friendly interface


## Technology Stack
Frontend: React
Backend: Express.js
Database: SQL

## What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?
I needed to build a To-Do application with a user-friendly interface that allows adding, completing, and deleting tasks. These tasks had to be stored in a SQL database, and the UI needed to reflect the tasks' real-time statuses. 
    I used React for the front end 'useState' and 'useEffect'  
    I used Axios to make calls to the backend, allowing for real-time task management.
    I used styling to differentiate between completed tasks and incomplete tasks. Such as different background color, per assignment requirement and strikethrough text.
